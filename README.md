# Respectful Recipe

## What it does

- The consumer (and user) shouldn't be judged on its consumption habits or even worse, forced to drastically to change them.
- Neither being ashamed.
- But should be encouraged!

** Soft > Rude **

That's why we developed a discrete browser extension that gives you it's proper evaluation of **The Real cost of food*** . But we didn't stop there: we also provide - as a suggestion - similar recipes that are on the same website, but with a better score.

**But wait, how's that score calculated?**
The score, between 0 and 100% takes several criteria : 
- CO2 emissions (mostly based on)
- All the ingredients are considered individually (season, CO2 emission and so on).

Thanks to Data Analysis, we are able to provide relevant scores from one of the biggest USA recipe websites, AllRecipes.com. Since they are not (for now!) our client, we had to scrap some data to fill up our database (about 10k recipes... *whistles*)

In the future (and this will be part of our business plan), we will provide some tools and APIs to food-related companies so they can use our extension on their own products, based on their own data to create their proper food awareness experience and better relationships with their clients.

* The proof of work we developed during those 40 hours is recipe-focused, for now...!

## Getting started

- First, you need to download the extension and add it to your Chrome browser (Edge, Opera, Firefox are on the way!). Just follow this tutorial:
- Just go on any www.AllRecipes.com recipe and have a look at the right sidebar, there is a gauche (like on the thumbnail!), you can already use it, everything is orchestrated behind ;)
- Enjoy!
